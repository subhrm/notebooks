Here’s why CountVectorizer is preferred for LDA:\n","\n","#### 1. Probabilistic Nature of LDA\n","LDA is a generative probabilistic model that assumes each document is generated by a mixture of topics, and each topic is generated by a mixture of words. This process relies on simple term frequency counts:\n","\n","LDA assigns probabilities to words based on how often they appear in documents, helping to determine which topics are likely present.\n","Since LDA calculates these probabilities based on raw counts, CountVectorizer provides exactly what it needs.\n","#### 2. TF-IDF’s Focus on Rare Terms\n","TfidfVectorizer applies a weighting scheme that downplays common terms (like \"car\" or \"engine\" in an automotive topic) and up-weights rare terms, which might not always suit LDA’s probabilistic model:\n","\n","TF-IDF emphasizes terms that are unique or rare within a corpus, rather than terms that are frequently discussed within a particular topic.\n","Because LDA does not focus on distinguishing unique terms but rather on uncovering word patterns that reflect underlying topics, the raw count matrix works better.\n","#### 3. Interpretable Topic Composition\n","Using CountVectorizer provides a direct interpretation of LDA topics by showing the most frequent and contextually relevant words associated with each topic. This aligns well with LDA's goal of representing topics as a set of words likely to co-occur, which is easier to interpret with raw counts.\n","\n","## Why we shound NOT use TF-IDF Vectorizer for LatentDirichletAllocation\n","> Using **TF-IDF Vectorizer** with **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** is generally not recommended because it doesn't align with the probabilistic foundation of LDA, which relies on raw word frequencies to model topics effectively. However, in some specific cases, TF-IDF may still be useful when combined with LDA:\n","\n","### Reducing the Influence of Common Words Across All Topics:\n","\n","In certain cases, common terms that are not truly informative for topic distinction may dominate the dataset (e.g., \"report,\" \"data,\" \"result\").\n","TF-IDF can help by downweighting terms that appear across many documents, allowing LDA to better capture distinctive patterns of terms for specific topics. This could improve topic differentiation if there is a large volume of non-informative common words.\n","\n","### Small or Highly Homogeneous Corpora:\n","\n","For smaller corpora or very homogeneous datasets, where most documents are quite similar, raw counts may not differentiate well between topics, since all documents may use similar vocabulary.\n","TF-IDF can increase the weight of rarer terms, potentially allowing LDA to identify subtle topic distinctions.\n","\n","### Exploratory Analysis:\n","\n","If you are experimenting with topic modeling and interested in finding rare, unique words that define topics more than general themes, using TF-IDF may reveal different patterns, though they might be less coherent.\n","However, this should be seen more as an exploratory method rather than a best practice for topic modeling with LDA.\n","\n","### Limitations of Using TF-IDF with LDA\n","Misalignment with LDA’s Assumptions: LDA assumes a multinomial distribution of terms based on raw counts. TF-IDF introduces non-integer weights that can distort the intended probabilistic topic-word distribution.\n","Loss of Co-occurrence Patterns: By prioritizing rare terms, TF-IDF may weaken the signal of words that naturally co-occur in topics, leading to less coherent topics."],"metadata":{"id":"R0uyAlv7LvBH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## References\n","### 1. **Original Paper on LDA**  \n","   - **\"Latent Dirichlet Allocation\" by David M.
